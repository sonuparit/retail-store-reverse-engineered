# ⚙️ Productionizing a Microservices Application (Reverse-Engineered) | In Progress..

> [!NOTE]
> This project is based on an existing application that I reverse-engineered and enhanced — [original repo](https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app)

## 🚀 Project Goal

*The goal of this project is not just deployment, but to build a production-like DevOps ecosystem independently that showcases a strong understanding of real-world DevOps practices, including:*

- **Containerization**
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**
- **CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Real-Time Alerts**
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **Monitoring**
- **Automation**

## 🎯 Objectives and Sub-goals

1. **📚 To understand the application architecture:**  
*Analyze and reverse-engineer the microservices architecture to gain a deep understanding of how the system works.*

2. **🐳 Containerization:**  
    - *Containerize all services using Docker.*
    - *Docker Compose Setup*
    - *Run and manage multi-container application locally using **`Docker Compose`.***

3. **☸️ Kubernetes Deployment:**  
*Deploy and manage the application in a **`Kubernetes cluster.`***

4. **ↈ CI/CD Implementation:**  
*Build complete **`CI/CD`** pipelines using:*
    - ***`GitOps`** approach **`(ArgoCD)`***
    - ***`Jenkins approach`** (traditional pipeline)*

5. **📧 Notification System:**  
*Integrate **`email and Slack notifications`** for pipeline events and alerts.*

6. **🏗️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  
*Provision infrastructure using **`Terraform`** for automated and consistent environments.*

7. **📊 Observability:**  
*Implement monitoring and visualization using:*
    - ***`Prometheus`** (metrics collection)*
    - ***`Grafana`** (dashboard visualization)*

8. **⚡ Finally Full Automation:**  
*Enable complete infrastructure and application setup with a single command:*

    ```yml
    terraform apply
    ```

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

- **Designed and deployed** a production-like microservices system on Kubernetes
- Implemented secure, **cloud-native integrations** (DynamoDB, EBS, IAM)
- Applied **real-world DevOps** practices: containerization, orchestration, IaC, and GitOps
- Built systems with **security-first, scalability-aware, and failure-resilient design**
- **Debugged and stabilized** distributed systems across infra, networking, and application layers

## 🕵 Why I Chose This Project

### 🧗‍♂️ This project is intentionally outside my comfort zone

*I am primarily proficient in **`Python`** and **`JavaScript`**, and deploying applications using these technologies is something I can do with confidence. However, I wanted to challenge myself with something more complex and unfamiliar.*

**💡 That’s why I chose a different technology with microservices architecture.**

### 📌 At the time of starting this project

- *I had **`no prior experience with Java`***
- *The system consists of **`5 independent microservices`***
- *The architecture is significantly more complex than typical projects*

**🧩 Instead of avoiding this gap, I decided to use it as an opportunity to grow.**

## 💥 Key Improvements Over Original System

- Introduced **persistent storage** (DynamoDB + EBS)
- Eliminated **hardcoded secrets** using IAM + Secrets Manager + IMDSv2
- Removed unnecessary dependencies (**Redis, MariaDB**)
- Optimized container images (**−190MB**)

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ Microservices containerized and orchestrated (**Docker → Kubernetes**)
- ✅ **Stateful + stateless** services implemented with production patterns
- ✅ Secure **cloud integrations** (IAM, Secrets Manager, IMDSv2, DynamoDB, EBS)
- 🚧 GitOps (**ArgoCD**) in progress...
