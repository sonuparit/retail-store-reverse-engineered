## 📦 Deployment Guide

This section walks through deploying the full multi-environment GitOps setup on a kind Kubernetes cluster running on EC2.

> [!NOTE]

### Prerequisites

**Infra:**

1. **EC2 instance** (recommended flex.large for multi env)

  This enabled:

  - Continuous reconciliation
  - Declarative infrastructure management
  - Scalable multi-environment deployments
  - Cleaner operational workflows

- ### 2. Layered Repository & Platform Segmentation

  - Improved operational consistency

## ⚔️ Challenges & Solutions

- ### 1. Architectural Refactor for GitOps Adoption

  - **⚔️ Challenge:**\
    Initial infrastructure provisioning relied on sequential Bash scripts for ArgoCD, applications, monitoring, and logging deployments. While functional during iterative development, the approach was not aligned with GitOps workflows.

  - **🔍 Analysis:**\
    To implement GitOps properly, ArgoCD needed to become the single deployment controller responsible for continuous reconciliation and application lifecycle management.

  - **🧠 Root Cause:**\
    The repository structure was originally optimized for imperative script-based deployments rather than declarative GitOps operations.

  - **✅ Solution:**\
    Refactored the repository architecture to support GitOps-driven deployments through ArgoCD.

    **This enabled:**
    - Declarative infrastructure and application management
    - Cleaner deployment workflows
    - Easier environment scalability
    - Centralized synchronization via ArgoCD

  - **📚 Lesson Learned:**\
    Design repositories around the target operational model from the beginning. Retrofitting architecture later becomes significantly more expensive.

- ### 2. ArgoCD Project Permission Segmentation

  - **⚔️ Challenge:**\
    All deployments were initially running under ArgoCD's default project with broad cluster-wide permissions. I wanted to implement stricter project isolation and resource scoping.

  - **🔍 Analysis:**\
    Production-grade GitOps requires separation between cluster-scoped and namespace-scoped resources to enforce security boundaries and reduce blast radius.

  - **🧠 Root Cause:**\
    The repository lacked architectural separation between infrastructure, platform, observability, and application layers, making Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) implementation difficult.

  - **✅ Solution:**\
    Re-architected the repository into dedicated deployment layers:
    - **Infrastructure Layer** → Kind, Terraform
    - **Platform Layer** → ESO and shared platform services
    - **Observability Layer** → Prometheus stack, exporters, logging
    - **Application Layer** → Business applications and services

      ![alt text](./screenshots/arch.jpg)

    Implemented ArgoCD Projects with scoped permissions and controlled deployment boundaries.

    **This enabled:**
    - Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
    - Clear separation of concerns
    - Safer RBAC implementation
    - Better dependency management between layers
    - Production-grade GitOps organization

  - **📚 Lesson Learned:**\
    Strong architecture simplifies security, scalability, and operational control.

- ### 3. Layered Deployment Synchronization Failure

  - **⚔️ Challenge:**\
    ArgoCD was deploying all layers simultaneously despite sync wave configuration. Applications eventually recovered through Kubernetes reconciliation, but deployment ordering was unreliable.

  - **🔍 Analysis:**\
    Sync waves alone were insufficient because ArgoCD could not accurately determine application health states during deployment.

  - **🧠 Root Cause:**\
    Custom applications lacked health checks, preventing ArgoCD from validating readiness before progressing to dependent layers.

  - **✅ Solution:**\
    Implemented custom Lua health checks for ArgoCD to enforce proper health validation and layered deployment sequencing.

    **This enabled:**
    - Deterministic deployment ordering
    - Safer progressive rollouts
    - Reduced deployment instability
    - Reliable dependency-aware synchronization

  - **📚 Lesson Learned:**\
    Deployment orchestration is only as reliable as the health signals provided to the controller.

- ### 4. Lua Health Checks Not Taking Effect

  - **⚔️ Challenge:**\
    After implementing Lua health checks, ArgoCD still continued deploying layers in parallel.

  - **🔍 Analysis:**\
    The Lua scripts were valid, but ArgoCD was not applying the updated health configurations.

  - **🧠 Root Cause:**\
    ArgoCD Repo Server and ArgoCD Server required restarts to reload the newly applied project configurations and Lua health scripts.

  - **✅ Solution:**\
    Updated the ArgoCD installation automation to automatically restart:
    - ArgoCD Repo Server
    - ArgoCD Server

    after project and health configuration changes.

    **This enabled:**
    - Reliable health check enforcement
    - Consistent layered deployments
    - Fully automated configuration propagation

  - **📚 Lesson Learned:**\
    Configuration changes are ineffective unless the consuming services reload them correctly.

- ### 5. ArgoCD ServiceMonitors Missing in Prometheus

  - **⚔️ Challenge:**\
    ArgoCD ServiceMonitors existed in Kubernetes but were not visible in Prometheus, resulting in missing metrics collection.

  - **🔍 Analysis:**\
    No immediate errors were visible. After reapplying configurations post-monitoring stack deployment, the ServiceMonitors appeared and metrics collection resumed.

  - **🧠 Root Cause:**\
    ArgoCD attempted to create ServiceMonitor resources before the Prometheus Operator CRDs were installed. Since the CRDs did not yet exist, Kubernetes silently ignored the resources.

  - **✅ Solution:**\
    Removed ServiceMonitor creation from the ArgoCD Helm values configuration and moved monitoring resources into the dedicated Observability layer. Deployment sequencing ensured ServiceMonitors were only applied after Prometheus Operator CRDs became available.

    **This enabled:**
    - Reliable Prometheus target discovery
    - Stable metrics collection
    - Proper dependency-aware resource deployment
    - Cleaner observability architecture

  - **📚 Lesson Learned:**\
    CRD-dependent resources must only be deployed after their controllers and CRDs are fully available.
