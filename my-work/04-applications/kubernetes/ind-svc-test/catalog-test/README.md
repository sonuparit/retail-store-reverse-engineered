## 📌 Overview

*While reverse engineering this retail microservices app, I focused on understanding service interactions, persistence strategies, and deployment across Docker and Kubernetes.*

*Instead of replicating everything blindly, I made selective architectural decisions — keeping implementations that added real learning value (**`DynamoDB for Cart, PostgreSQL for Orders`**) and removing redundant ones.*

*This approach helped me stay focused on orchestration, system behavior, and production-relevant trade-offs rather than repeating similar integrations.*

## ⚙️ Core Implementation

*Analyzed application configuration and environment dependencies to fully decouple persistence requirements from service runtime behavior.*

- *Created and validated all required Kubernetes deployment resources*

- *Implemented only the minimum runtime configuration required for stable in-memory execution*

## 🏛️ Architectural Decisions

***Context:***

*The Catalog service originally relied on MariaDB for item storage. However, the project scope did not involve dynamic catalog management, and Persistence-related architectural patterns had already been validated through DynamoDB and PostgreSQL integrations implemented in other services.*

***Rationale:***

- *No requirement to actively manage or mutate catalog data*
- *Persistence patterns already implemented using DynamoDB (Cart) and PostgreSQL (Orders)*
- *Avoided duplicating the same database integration pattern*
- *Reduced unnecessary operational overhead*
- *Kept focus on Kubernetes orchestration and infrastructure automation*

### Final Architectural Decision

*MariaDB integration was intentionally excluded from this service implementation to reduce unnecessary operational complexity and maintain focus on orchestration, infrastructure behavior, and Kubernetes validation workflows.*

## ⚔️ Challenges & Solutions

*The service initially contained tightly coupled persistence assumptions, requiring careful validation of runtime behavior to isolate and safely remove unnecessary database dependencies.*

***My approach:***

- *Analyzed requirement from source code (**`config.go`**)*

- *Confirmed everywhere for **requirements for** **`in-memory storage`** implementation*

- ***`Simulated the output`** to see the requirements*

  - *password (**`never blank`**). Although it looks blank*

  - *endpoint (**`must be ""`**) for in-memory storage*

    ![alt text](screenshots/screenshot02.png)

- *Implemented only **`which is required`**.*

## 📈 Operational Outcomes

***`Simplified the architecture while preserving learning depth where it mattered`**. This allowed faster iteration and better focus on system design, service interaction, and deployment strategies.*

*App working as intended:*

## 🎓 Key Learnings

- *Learned to **`validate systems incrementally`** — testing services in isolation before full orchestration improved reliability and debugging clarity*

- *Gained **`hands-on experience in reverse engineering systems`** — an invaluable skill for translating legacy applications into scalable microservices architectures.*

- *Built practical experience in **`choosing the right persistence layer based on use case`**, instead of applying everything to everywhere*

- *Realized the **`importance of intentional architecture decisions`** — removing components that add complexity without adding learning or value.*

- *Strengthened my ability to **`think in terms of system design trade-offs`**, not just implementation*
