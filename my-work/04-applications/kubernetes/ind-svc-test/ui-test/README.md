## 📖 Overview

*This implementation focused on validating the UI service within Kubernetes while intentionally separating runtime observability concerns from application-layer logic.*

*The primary objective was to maintain an environment-agnostic application design and shift infrastructure visibility responsibilities toward dedicated observability tooling.*

## ⚙️ Core Implementation

*Analyzed application runtime dependencies and infrastructure-awareness patterns within Kubernetes environments.*

- *Removed environment-detection variables to preserve application-level environment abstraction*

- *Created and validated all required Kubernetes deployment resources*

## 🏛️ Architectural Decisions

***Context:***

*The UI service relied on environment-based auto-detection using runtime variables to identify its execution environment. While functional, `this mixed observability concerns with the application code`, which I prefer to keep separate*

***Rationale:***

- *Application should not be `aware of its execution environment`*
- *Mixing application logic with observability increases unnecessary complexity and state management.*
- *Results in mixed logs that don’t directly relate to each other*
- *Better to use tools like **`Prometheus`** to maintain separation of concerns*
- *Can be good for local development.*

### The Decision

*Removed the internal metadata provider to later implement **`Prometheus-based service discovery`**, offloading observability to the infrastructure layer where it belongs.*

## ⚔️ Challenges & Solutions

The primary challenge involved identifying hidden abstraction layers responsible for runtime environment introspection and understanding how infrastructure-awareness was embedded within application behavior.

***My approach:***

- *Analyzed source code, to better understand the code behavior (**`KubernetesMetadataProvider.java`**)*

- Removed runtime environment-detection variables responsible for infrastructure introspection behavior

## 📈 Operational Outcomes

*Successfully validated the UI service within Kubernetes while maintaining an environment-agnostic runtime model.*

*This implementation improved separation of concerns by decoupling infrastructure observability behavior from application-layer logic and reinforced cleaner operational architecture boundaries.*

## 🎓 Key Learnings

- *Learned to enforce **`clear separation of concerns`** by decoupling observability from application logic, improving system clarity and maintainability.*

- *Recognized that applications should remain **`environment-agnostic`**, avoiding implicit dependencies on runtime context.*

- *Learned to **`validate systems incrementally`** — testing services in isolation before full orchestration improved reliability and debugging clarity.*

- *Gained **`hands-on experience in reverse engineering systems`** — an invaluable skill for translating legacy applications into scalable microservices architectures.*

## 🔭 Next Phase

*Helm templating all micro services [(read here)](../../helm-template/)*

## 📸 Screenshots

- *Created all K8s resources and validated them*

- *Deployed single service to validate it's operational*
