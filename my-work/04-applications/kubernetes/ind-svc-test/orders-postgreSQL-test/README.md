## 📖 Overview

*This implementation focused on transitioning the Orders service from ephemeral mock storage to a production-oriented PostgreSQL persistence architecture within Kubernetes.*

*The primary objective was to validate durable storage behavior, StatefulSet orchestration patterns, and cloud-backed persistence using AWS EBS-integrated Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims.*

## ⚙️ Core Implementation

- *Created all resources for **`Orders`** service*

    ![alt text](screenshots/screenshot20.png)

- *Replaced in-memory / local postgreSQL image storage with **`persistent PostgreSQL database storage`***

    ![alt text](screenshots/screenshot15.png)

- *Attached EBS volume to **`persist the data after cluster dispose`** using **`PV and PVC`***

- Implemented Pod-level `fsGroup` security context configuration to ensure PostgreSQL containers received correct read/write permissions on attached EBS-backed storage volumes

- *Implemented **`PGDATA`** env variable variable to mitigate **`drive not empty`**) error*

## 🏛️ Architectural Decisions

### RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ integration was intentionally excluded to reduce unnecessary stateful infrastructure complexity during this implementation phase.

The primary focus remained on:

- Kubernetes orchestration
- persistent storage behavior
- infrastructure automation
- CI/CD workflows
- operational reliability

### The Decision

- *I chose to keep the application logic synchronous to my `GOAL` to ensure the fully automated infrastructure workflows remains the star of the show.*

### PostgreSQL (PV & PVC)

Order-related data required durable persistence beyond pod or cluster lifecycle events. To support production-oriented storage behavior, AWS EBS-backed Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims were implemented for PostgreSQL state management.

### The Decision

- *Adopted **`persistent PostgreSQL`** storage for the orders service.*

## ⚔️ Challenges & Solutions

### Problem

***PostgreSQL Initialization Failure on EBS Volumes:***\
*While implementing persistent storage for the orders-db service using AWS EBS volumes, the PostgreSQL container failed to initialize with the following error:*

```bash
initdb: error: directory "/var/lib/postgresql/data" exists but is not empty (lost+found found)
```

![alt text](screenshots/screenshot17.png)

- ***Technical Root Cause:***\
*Block Storage Metadata: AWS EBS volumes (ext4/xfs) automatically include a lost+found directory at the mount point root.*

- ***PostgreSQL Initialization Constraints:***\
*The initdb utility requires a completely empty directory to initialize a new database cluster to prevent accidental data overwrites.*

- ***Permission Mismatch:***\
*By default, EBS volumes are mounted with root ownership, preventing the postgres user (UID 999) from creating sub-directories.*

### The Engineered Solution

***I resolved this by implementing a two-tier configuration strategy in the Kubernetes `StatefulSet`:***

1. ***Decoupling Storage Root from Data Root (`PGDATA`):***\
*Instead of using the volume mount point root as the data directory, I utilized the PGDATA environment variable to point PostgreSQL to a **`sub-directory:`***

    - ***Mount Path**: **`/var/lib/postgresql/data`** (Points to the EBS hardware)*

        ![alt text](screenshots/screenshot18.png)

    - ***PGDATA Path**: **`/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata`** (A clean sub-folder managed by Postgres)*

    ***This bypasses the lost+found folder conflict while ensuring all data still persists on the EBS volume.***

    ![alt text](screenshots/screenshot11.png)

2. ***Automated Volume Ownership (`fsGroup`):***\
*To handle the permission handshake between the AWS infrastructure and the Linux container, I configured a **`Pod-level Security Context`**:*

    ```yml
    securityContext:
        fsGroup: 999
    ```

    ![alt text](screenshots/screenshot04.png)

    *This instructs Kubernetes to recursively change the ownership of the EBS volume to the postgres group ID upon attachment, ensuring the database process has the necessary read/write privileges without manual intervention.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 Operational Outcomes

**Zero-Touch Persistence:**\
*Successfully integrated AWS EBS with a StatefulSet, ensuring database records survive Pod restarts or node failures without manual data recovery.*

**Resolved Storage Collisions:**\
*Automated the bypass of the lost+found block storage error by reconfiguring the `PGDATA` path, allowing for seamless automated database initialization.*

**Infrastructure-as-Code Security:**\
*Implemented Pod-level Security Contexts (fsGroup), enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege by ensuring the container only accesses necessary storage volumes without requiring root permissions.*

**Production-Ready Stability:**\
*Achieved a stable "Ready" state for the retail-app data tier, handling the complex handshake between AWS infrastructure and Kubernetes storage primitives.*

## 🎓 Key Learnings

*Moving from a stateless mock environment to a persistent production-grade architecture taught me that the `devil is in the details` of the infrastructure handshake. Here are my core takeaways:*

**1. Decoupling Storage from Logic:**

- *I learned that managing state in Kubernetes isn't just about attaching a disk.Iit’s about managing the lifecycle of data. Implementing PVs and PVCs taught me how to abstract physical storage (AWS EBS) from the application pods, ensuring data outlives the compute.*

**2. Navigating the "Impedance Mismatch" of Cloud Storage:**

- *The `lost+found error` was a masterclass in how Linux filesystems and database engines interact. I learned that production-ready configurations require a deep understanding of how tools like `initdb` behave, leading me to use `PGDATA` sub-directories as a standard practice for clean initializations.*

**3. Security-First Infrastructure:**

- *My experience with fsGroup reinforced the importance of the Principle of Least Privilege. I realized that solving Permission Denied errors by using `chmod 777` is a debt-heavy shortcut. Instead, I focused on using Kubernetes Security Contexts to handle volume ownership gracefully and securely.*

**4. StatefulSet Nuances:**

- *Working with PostgreSQL in K8s highlighted why StatefulSets are preferred over Deployments for databases. I gained a better grasp of stable network identifiers and the necessity of ordered, graceful deployments when dealing with persistent data.*

**6. Production-Oriented Thinking over Local Success:**

- *Transitioned from it works locally to it survives restarts, failures, and redeployments, focusing on durability, reproducibility, and zero-touch recovery.*
