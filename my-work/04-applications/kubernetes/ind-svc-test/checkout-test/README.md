## 📌 Overview

*This implementation focused on validating the Checkout microservice within Kubernetes while intentionally minimizing unnecessary persistence complexity.*

*The primary objective was to understand how stateless service workflows behave under container orchestration without introducing infrastructure components that provided limited architectural or operational value.*

## 🏛️ Architectural Decision

***Context:***

*For this checkout service, the workflow does not require durable or shared state across instances. The checkout process can be deterministically **`reconstructed from the cart`** at any time. Given this, Redis looked like an over-engineered solution, adding infrastructure and maintenance complexity without clear benefit.*

***Rationale:***

- **`No requirement for persisted intermediate orchestration data.`**
- *Persistence patterns already implemented using DynamoDB (Cart) and PostgreSQL (Orders).*
- *Avoided unnecessary database integration.*
- *Reduced unnecessary operational overhead.*
- **`Kept focus on Kubernetes orchestration and infrastructure automation.`**

### Final Architectural Decision

*Redis integration was intentionally excluded to preserve a stateless workflow model and reduce unnecessary infrastructure overhead during Kubernetes service validation.*

## 🔧 Key Implementations

*Analyzed runtime configuration and service dependencies to safely remove unnecessary Redis-related integration requirements.*

- *Created and validated all required Kubernetes deployment resources*

- *Simplified runtime configuration by removing persistence-related environment variables not required for stateless execution*

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

The service initially contained persistence-oriented configuration assumptions that required careful validation to determine whether Redis integration was operationally necessary.

***My approach:***

- *Analyzed requirement from source code (**`configuration.ts`**)*

- *Confirmed everywhere for **requirements for** in-memory storage implementation*

- Removed persistence-specific environment variables not required for stateless runtime behavior

## ✅ Outcome

*The Checkout service was successfully validated in Kubernetes using a simplified stateless architecture model.*

*This approach reduced operational complexity while preserving focus on orchestration behavior, service interaction patterns, and infrastructure-level learning objectives.*

## 💡 Key Learnings

- *Learned to **`validate systems incrementally`** — testing services in isolation before full orchestration improved reliability and debugging clarity.*

- *Gained **`hands-on experience in reverse engineering systems`** — an invaluable skill for translating legacy applications into scalable microservices architectures.*

- *Built practical experience in **`choosing the right persistence layer based on use case`**, instead of applying everything to everywhere.*

- ***`Realized the importance of intentional architecture decisions`** — removing components that add complexity without adding learning or value.*

- *Strengthened my ability to **`think in terms of system design trade-offs`**, not just implementation*
