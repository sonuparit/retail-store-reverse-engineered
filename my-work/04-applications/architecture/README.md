# 🏗️ Reverse Engineered to gain Architectural Understanding

This project is a retail store application built using a microservices architecture (5 services). I reverse-engineered the system to gain a deep understanding of service communication, dependencies, and Kubernetes-oriented design patterns.

## 📌 Overview

**Performed architectural analysis of the application by studying:**

- *Application source code*
- *Service dependencies*
- *Environment variables and runtime configurations*
- *API communication patterns*
- *Containerization requirements*

**This process helped map the end-to-end service flow and identify how microservices interact within a Kubernetes-oriented environment.**

| Component            | Language |  Description                            |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| UI                   | Java     | Store user interface                    |
| Catalog              | Go       | Product catalog API                     |
| Cart                 | Java     | User shopping carts API                 |
| Orders               | Java     | User orders API                         |
| Checkout             | Node     | API to orchestrate the checkout process |

## 🧠 What I Discovered

**Architecture Insights:**

- *Stateless microservices architecture*
- *Cloud-native service design patterns*
- *Container-oriented application structure*
- *Internal API-based service communication*
- *Kubernetes-friendly workload separation*
- *Ephemeral workload design*
- *Supports optional integration with external databases if needed*

## 🧬 Why this design?

**This architecture appears intentionally optimized for:**

- *State/Stateless workload orchestration*
- *Production oriented workflows*
- *Reduced infrastructure dependency management*
- *Cloud-native deployment environments*
- *Rapid experimentation in Kubernetes ecosystems*
- *Service-level isolation and modularity*

## 🎓 Key Learnings

**This reverse-engineering process strengthened my understanding of:**

- *Distributed system architecture*
- *Microservices communication patterns*
- *Container-first application design*
- *Kubernetes-oriented deployment models*
- *Service dependency mapping*
- *Operational considerations in cloud-native environments*

**It also established the architectural foundation required for later implementation phases involving containerization, orchestration, GitOps workflows, observability, and infrastructure automation.**

## 📌 Conclusion

This architectural analysis phase provided a strong foundation for understanding how modern cloud-native microservices are structured, deployed, and orchestrated within Kubernetes-oriented environments.

The project served as a practical entry point into distributed systems design, containerized workloads, service communication patterns, and production-style application architecture.
