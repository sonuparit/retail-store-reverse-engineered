- environment-aware monitoring
- declarative observability configuration

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
```

---

## 🧪 Operational Validation on Single Microservice

Before scaling observability cluster-wide, initially tested monitoring integration on a single microservice (Catalog).

Validated:
- metrics endpoint exposure
- Prometheus target discovery
- ServiceMonitor selectors
- Grafana metric visibility
- Kubernetes service-to-target resolution

This reduced debugging complexity and enabled controlled observability rollout.

---

## 🧩 Helmified ServiceMonitors for Multi-Environment Deployment

Converted observability resources into reusable Helm templates to support scalable multi-service and multi-environment deployments.

- application-specific log searches
- real-time log visibility

using LogQL queries such as:

```logql
{app="carts"}
```

and:

```logql
{env="stage"}
```

---

## 🏷️ Helmified Environment & Application Labeling Strategy

Helmified Kubernetes metadata labeling to standardize observability across multiple microservices and environments.

Implemented reusable labels for:
- application identification
- environment separation
- namespace-aware observability

using:

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    app: {{ .Chart.Name }}
    env: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
```

This enabled:
- clean metrics filtering

## ⚔️ Challenges & Solutions

[intro] 1 line

### 1. Prometheus Annotations Were Not Being Scraped

- **⚔️ Challenge:**\
Initially, application pods exposed Prometheus annotations like:

  ```yaml
  prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
  prometheus.io/port: "8080"
  prometheus.io/path: "/actuator/prometheus"
  ```

  However, no application metrics appeared in Prometheus targets.

- **🔍 Root Cause:**\
  The cluster was deployed using `kube-prometheus-stack`, which relies on the **Prometheus Operator** and primarily discovers targets using:

  - `ServiceMonitor`
  - `PodMonitor`

  instead of annotation-based scraping.

- **✅ Solution:**\
  Implemented dedicated `ServiceMonitor` resources for each microservice.

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
  kind: ServiceMonitor
  ```

  **This enabled:**
  - Kubernetes-native metric discovery
  - Declarative monitoring configuration
  - Automatic target generation by Prometheus Operator

---

### 2. ServiceMonitor Validation Failure

- **⚔️ Challenge:**\
  ArgoCD synchronization failed with:

  ```text
  spec.endpoints[0].port in body must be of type string
  ```

- **🔍 Root Cause:**\
  `ServiceMonitor.endpoints.port` was incorrectly configured using an integer:

  ```yaml
  port: 8080
  ```

  instead of a Service port name.

- **✅ Solution:**\
  Updated ServiceMonitor configuration to use named ports:

  ```yaml
  port: http
  ```

  which matched the Kubernetes Service port definition.

### 3. Label-Based Environment Monitoring

- **⚔️ Challenge:**\
  Metrics and logs needed to be separated cleanly between:

  - dev
  - stage
  - prod

  environments.

- **🔍 Root Cause:**\
  Without environment labels, observability data becomes difficult to filter and query across multiple namespaces.

- **✅ Solution:**\
  Implemented namespace-driven environment labels through Helm templating.

  ```yaml
  env: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  ```

  This enabled environment-aware queries such as:

  ```promql
  {env="stage"}
  ```

  and:

  ```logql
  {env="prod"}
  ```

### 4. Loki + Promtail Centralized Logging Integration

- **⚔️ Challenge:**\
  Implementing centralized logging with:

  - Loki
  - Promtail
  - Grafana

  while maintaining Kubernetes-native discovery and metadata labeling.

- **🔍 Root Cause:**\
  Promtail requires:

  - proper Kubernetes service discovery
  - relabeling
  - metadata enrichment
  - filesystem log access

  for accurate log ingestion.

- **✅ Solution:**\
  Configured Promtail with:

  - Kubernetes pod discovery
  - relabeling
  - namespace labels
  - app labels
  - container labels

  ```yaml
  relabel_configs:
    - source_labels:
        - __meta_kubernetes_namespace
      target_label: namespace
  ```

  This enabled:

  - centralized logging
  - label-based filtering
  - multi-environment log queries
  - Grafana Explore integration

### 5. Promtail CrashLoopBackOff (`too many open files`)

- **⚔️ Challenge:**\
  Promtail repeatedly crashed with:

  ```text
  failed to make file target manager: too many open files
  ```

- **🔍 Root Cause:**\
  Promtail creates filesystem watchers for Kubernetes container logs.  
  The node-level Linux inotify limits were too low for:

  - multiple namespaces
  - monitoring stack logs
  - microservices
  - cluster-wide log discovery

- **✅ Solution:**\
  Increased Linux kernel inotify limits:

  ```bash
  fs.inotify.max_user_instances=10000
  fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1048576
  ```

  <details>
  <summary>
  Make the changes permanent
  </summary>

  The `sysctl -w` command only changes the limits in memory. If your node reboots, the error will return. To make them permanent:

  1. Open the configuration file:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

  ```

  1. Add these lines to the bottom of the file:

  ```text
  fs.inotify.max_user_instances=10000
  fs.inotify.max_user_watches=1048576

  ```

  1. Save and exit, then apply them:

  ```bash
  sudo sysctl -p

  ```

  </details>

  **Additionally:**\
  optimized Promtail discovery scope to reduce unnecessary log ingestion.

  This resolved:

  - Promtail CrashLoopBackOff
  - file descriptor exhaustion
  - filesystem watcher saturation

### 6. Multi-Environment Observability Architecture

- **⚔️ Challenge:**\
  Avoid repetitive monitoring manifests for every microservice and needed production-oriented observability across:

  - multiple namespaces
  - multiple environments
  - multiple microservices

- **🔍 Root Cause:**\
  Hardcoded monitoring resources increase operational overhead and reduce scalability.

- **✅ Solution:**\
  Implemented reusable Helm templating for:

  - labels
  - Services
  - ServiceMonitors
  - environment-aware metadata

  This enabled:

  - reusable deployment patterns
  - scalable monitoring architecture
  - cleaner GitOps workflows
  
### 6. Containers restarting again and again

  Linveness probe was too agressive

  Increased liveness probe delay time 
  
  
  
The reason Alertmanager didn't appear initially, and now it does, is due to how the **Prometheus Operator** (the controller managing your stack) handles configurations.

When you use the `kube-prometheus-stack`, you aren't creating Pods directly; you are providing a "recipe" to the Operator. If that recipe has a logical error, the Operator simply refuses to cook—meaning it won't even attempt to create the Pods.

Here are the three specific things I changed and why they were blocking you:

### 1. The "Empty Receiver" Validation

In your original file, you defined a receiver named `default-receiver`, but it had no configuration (no email, no slack, no webhook).

* **The Problem:** Alertmanager has a strict validation check. A receiver must have at least one integration. Because yours was empty, the configuration was technically "invalid."
* **The Fix:** I added a placeholder `webhook_config` (pointing to localhost). This satisfied the validation check, allowing the Operator to accept the configuration and start the Pod.

### 2. Explicit Storage Class

In your `alertmanagerSpec`, you had a `volumeClaimTemplate` but didn't specify a `storageClassName`.

* **The Problem:** While some clusters have a "default" storage class, many (especially on AWS/EKS or manual installs) require you to be explicit. If the Operator tried to create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) without a valid class, the process would hang or fail before the Pod could even be scheduled.
* **The Fix:** I explicitly set it to `standard` to match your Prometheus configuration.

### 3. Indentation and Hierarchy

YAML is extremely sensitive to spaces. In your original file:

* The `retention: 7d` line under Prometheus was indented incorrectly (it had 4 spaces instead of 2 relative to `prometheusSpec`).
* There were commented-out lines that had "broken" the indentation flow for the blocks below them.
* **The Fix:** I normalized the indentation so that the Helm chart could correctly map your `values.yaml` to the Kubernetes Custom Resources.

### How the Architecture Works

To understand why these changes "triggered" the appearance of the pod, look at the flow:

1. **Helm** takes your `values.yaml` and creates a Kubernetes object called an **Alertmanager Custom Resource (CR)**.
2. **The Prometheus Operator** watches for changes to that CR.
3. **The Validation Step:** The Operator reads your `config` block. If it’s valid (has a receiver, correct syntax), the Operator generates a **Secret** containing the config and then creates a **StatefulSet**.
4. **The Pod Creation:** The StatefulSet finally creates the **Alertmanager Pod**.

By fixing the config and storage, we allowed the **Operator** to move from Step 2 to Step 3. Previously, it was likely stuck at Step 2, logging an error in the background saying, "I can't create this Alertmanager because the configuration is invalid."
