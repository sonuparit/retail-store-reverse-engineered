## ⚙️ Core Implementation

- ### 1. Monitoring Stack Deployment

  Installed a production-oriented monitoring stack using Helm charts:

  - Prometheus
  - Grafana
  - Alertmanager
  - Node Exporter
  - kube-state-metrics

  via:

  ```bash
  kube-prometheus-stack
  ```

  This provided:

  - Centralized metrics collection
  - Kubernetes cluster monitoring
  - Grafana dashboard integration
  - Prometheus Operator support
  - Alertmanager
  - ServiceMonitor CRDs

- ### 2. ServiceMonitor-Based Metrics Discovery

  Implemented Kubernetes-native monitoring using `ServiceMonitor` resources instead of annotation-based scraping.

  Created dedicated `ServiceMonitor` manifests for microservices to enable:

  ![alt text](./screenshots/ss32.png)

  - automatic target discovery
  - Prometheus Operator integration
  - environment-aware monitoring
  - declarative observability configuration

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
  kind: ServiceMonitor
  ```

- ### 3. Operational Validation on Single Microservice

  Before scaling observability cluster-wide, initially tested monitoring integration on a single microservice (Catalog).

  Validated:

  - metrics endpoint exposure
  - Prometheus target discovery
  - ServiceMonitor selectors
  - Grafana metric visibility
  - Kubernetes service-to-target resolution

  This reduced debugging complexity and enabled controlled observability rollout.

- ### 4. Helmified ServiceMonitors for Multi-Environment Deployment

  Converted observability resources into reusable Helm templates to support scalable multi-service and multi-environment deployments.

  Helmified:

  - labels
  - Services
  - ServiceMonitors
  - environment metadata
  - namespace-aware monitoring

   ![alt text](./screenshots/ss97.png)

  Successfully implemented centralized metrics aggregation for:

  - carts
  - checkout
  - orders
  - catalog
  - ui

  across env:

  - dev
  - stage
  - prod

  ![alt text](./screenshots/ss98.png)

  This enabled:

  - reusable monitoring architecture
  - centralized observability
  - environment-aware metrics discovery
  - cross-service visibility
  - simplified GitOps workflows
  - scalable Kubernetes monitoring

- ### 5. Loki & Promtail Deployment with Persistent Storage

  Installed Loki and Promtail using Helm charts with custom `values.yaml` configuration.

  Implemented:

  - PVC-backed persistent storage
  - filesystem-based log retention
  - Promtail Kubernetes discovery
  - resource-aware deployment configuration

  ![alt text](./screenshots/ss29.png)

  This ensured:

  - persistent log storage
  - centralized log ingestion
  - scalable observability architecture

- ### 6. Centralized Logging via Loki

  Implemented centralized Kubernetes logging using:

  - Loki
  - Promtail
  - Grafana Explore

  to aggregate logs from all microservices into a centralized observability platform.

  Enabled:

  - label-based log querying
  - namespace-aware filtering
  - application-specific log searches
  - real-time log visibility

  using LogQL queries such as:

  ```logql
  {app="carts"}
  ```

  ![alt text](./screenshots/ss106.png)

  and:

  ```logql
  {namespace="dev"}
  ```

  ![alt text](./screenshots/ss04.png)

- ### 7. Helmified Environment & Application Labeling Strategy

  Helmified Kubernetes metadata labeling to standardize observability across multiple microservices and environments.

  Implemented reusable labels for:

  - application identification
  - environment separation
  - namespace-aware observability

  using:

  ```yaml
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: {{ .Chart.Name }}
      env: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  ```

  This enabled:

  - clean metrics filtering
  - centralized log separation
  - multi-environment observability
  - Grafana label-based queries
  - reusable environment-aware deployments

- ### 8. Troubleshooting & Operational Problem Solving

  Resolved multiple production-oriented observability challenges during implementation, including:

  - Prometheus target discovery failures
  - ServiceMonitor selector mismatches
  - Incorrect ServiceMonitor port configuration
  - Environment label propagation
  - Promtail CrashLoopBackOff
  - Loki integration issues
  - Linux filesystem watcher exhaustion
  - Kubernetes service-to-container port mapping confusion
  - Understood Postgre exporter architecture

  This significantly improved operational understanding of:

  - Prometheus Operator internals
  - Kubernetes networking
  - Centralized logging architecture
  - Linux kernel tuning
  - Observability scaling considerations
  - Postgre exporter

- ### 9. Observability Validation

  Validated the complete observability pipeline through:

  - Prometheus Targets
  - Grafana Dashboards
  - Loki Explore
  - LogQL Queries
  - PromQL Queries
  - Custom alerting
  - Email & Slack Notification

  Successfully verified:

  - metrics scraping
  - multi-environment monitoring
  - centralized logging
  - live log ingestion
  - application-level telemetry
  - Kubernetes metadata enrichment
