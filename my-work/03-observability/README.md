  - automatic target discovery
  - Prometheus Operator integration
  - environment-aware monitoring
  - declarative observability configuration

  ```yaml

  Before scaling observability cluster-wide, initially tested monitoring integration on a single microservice (Catalog).

  Validated:

  - metrics endpoint exposure
  - Prometheus target discovery
  - ServiceMonitor selectors
  - Grafana metric visibility
  - Kubernetes service-to-target resolution

  This reduced debugging complexity and enabled controlled observability rollout.

  - application-specific log searches
  - real-time log visibility

  using LogQL queries such as:

  ```logql
  {app="carts"}
  ```

  ![alt text](./screenshots/ss106.png)

  and:

  ```logql
  {namespace="dev"}
  ```
